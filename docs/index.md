FIWARE-Augmented Reality
========================

This project is part of FIWARE http://www.fiware.org/

Augmented Reality Generic Enabler is a high-level application programming 
interface for HTML5 Augmented Reality applications. Required run-time 
environment is the JavaScript support of a suitable web browser. No plug-ins 
are required. These applications may rely on the functionality of the other 
GEs, like XML3D Technology, POI Data Provider, etc. 

For more information, please, visit http://catalogue.fiware.org/ and
specifically for documentation about Augmented Reality: 
http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/augmented-reality

This GE does not have a web (http, etc.) interface.
